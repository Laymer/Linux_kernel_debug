# debug-examples

debug-examples are supporting source codes for the internship report entitled "Debugging Linux Kernel" .

# Folder Structure
Folders are named according to their corresponding chapter (in the internship report) :
- **Chap1-userland-debug** : Examples used for debugging for the Userspace. 
- **Chap2-kernel-debug** : Sample examples made for Kernel debug illustration.
- **Chap3-tracers** :  Sources to support linux tracer demos.
- **Chap6-kernel-security** : Examples demonstrating some attacking vectors on both Userspace and kernel code.

# Dependencies
The examples are written in C/C++  and python.

### Install C/C++ compiler
Install C/C++ from the repository :
> sudo apt-get install  build-essential

### Install python
The Graphical user interface is based on **tkinter** which is required for proper operation of the some of the sample codes.

> sudo apt-get install python3-tk

# About the examples
The examples are academic oriented, and cannot be used in industry without more **sanitization**. The goal was to be short and concise. Security must be added to make them usable in real life.
